# tuxedo-control-nix

A NixOS-native, **declarative** replacement for TUXEDO laptop hardware control (fan
curves, performance profiles, keyboard backlight and charging profiles), built by
reverse-engineering the `tuxedo_io` kernel ioctl interface.

> ⚠️ **Safety.** This drives a **root daemon that writes to your laptop's embedded
> controller** (fan duty, EC registers). It can set the fan to 0%. The daemon enforces a
> temperature curve and restores the EC's automatic control on exit, but you run it at
> your own risk. Only **one** fan controller may run at a time, so disable `tailord`/`tccd`
> first. Validated on one model so far (see [Supported hardware](#supported-hardware)).

## Why this exists

On NixOS, TUXEDO hardware control has two unsatisfying options:

1. **TUXEDO Control Center (TCC)**: the official Electron app + `tccd` daemon. **Not
   packaged in nixpkgs**, and an Electron/Node app is awkward to package declaratively.
2. **tuxedo-rs / tailord**: a Rust daemon *is* in nixpkgs (`hardware.tuxedo-rs`), but its
   fan control **misbehaves on some Uniwill-based AMD models**. On the reference machine
   (TUXEDO **InfinityBook Pro AMD Gen9**, board `GXxHRXx`) tailord kept the fan loud at a
   cold idle: a GUI-set `enthusiast` performance profile stuck, and re-applying `power_save`
   over D-Bus did **not** quiet the fan at 35 °C even though the active curve was 0 % below
   49 °C. Disabling tailord and handing the fan back to the EC was the only fix that worked.

Both `tccd` and `tailord` drive the **same kernel interface**, `/dev/tuxedo_io`
(`tuxedo_io.ko`, from the GPL `tuxedo-drivers`). The plan: understand that ioctl protocol
directly, build a small correct daemon, and wrap it in a first-class NixOS module. No
Electron, no guessing.

## Goal

```nix
services.tuxedo-control = {
  enable = true;
  fan.curve = [ { temp = 25; speed = 0; } { temp = 50; speed = 0; } /* … */ ];
  performanceProfile = "power_save";   # decoupled from the fan curve
  chargeLimit = 80;
  keyboard.backlight = { color = "#ffaa00"; brightness = 40; };
};
```

A pure, declarative module that works on AMD/Uniwill boards, plus a flake
output for the daemon and a dev shell for the RE work.

## Status: all phases working on the reference machine ✅

Reference machine: InfinityBook Pro AMD Gen9 (Uniwill, `tuxedo_io` v0.3.9).

| Phase | Deliverable | State |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Recon: [`docs/hardware-interface.md`](docs/hardware-interface.md) | ✅ |
| 1 | **Protocol map + root-cause** in [`docs/phase1-protocol.md`](docs/phase1-protocol.md): every Uniwill ioctl, fan scaling (0–0xc8), the `0x40`-bit bug | ✅ source-derived |
| 2 | **Prober** (`prober/`): drives fan 0→60→auto; confirmed the protocol + fix on hardware | ✅ validated |
| 3 | **Daemon** (`daemon/`): temp→duty curve, hysteresis, clears `0x40` each tick, perf profile decoupled, restores EC auto on `SIGTERM` | ✅ validated |
| 4 | **NixOS module + flake** (`nix/`): `services.tuxedo-control`, declarative curve/profile; force-disables `tuxedo-rs`, loads `tuxedo_io` | ✅ evals + builds |
| 5 | **TUI** (`tui/`): live temps/fan/mode dashboard + quick controls | ✅ |
| 6 | **GUI** (`gui/`): libadwaita/GTK4 app — fan, performance profiles, keyboard backlight, charging profile, follow-system theme | ✅ |

Beyond the phases: **named performance profiles** with their own fan curves
(create/delete/set-default), built-in profiles modelled on TUXEDO Control Center, and
**import of TCC's exported profiles**. CI (`nix flake check` + clippy/fmt) runs on every
push, and the first tagged release is **[v0.1.0](../../releases/tag/v0.1.0)** (see
[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)).

**The bug, in one line:** `uw_set_fan` ignores the requested duty unless bit `0x40`
of EC RAM `0x0751` is clear. Once anything (a stuck perf/mode write) sets `0x40`, the EC
keeps the fan on its own loud curve. tuxedo-rs/tailord doesn't guard against this; this
daemon clears `0x40` before every fan write. Full analysis in `docs/phase1-protocol.md`.

## Usage

```sh
cargo build --release            # workspace: prober, daemon, tui   (or: nix build .#default)

sudo ./target/release/tuxedo-prober info     # read temps/fan/mode
sudo ./target/release/tuxedo-prober set 40   # both fans -> 40%
sudo ./target/release/tuxedo-prober auto     # hand back to the EC
sudo ./target/release/tuxedo-tui             # live dashboard
```

On NixOS, add this flake as an input and enable the module:

```nix
services.tuxedo-control = {
  enable = true;
  performanceProfile = "power_save";
  fan.curve = [
    { temp = 25; speed = 0; } { temp = 50; speed = 0; }
    { temp = 62; speed = 24; } { temp = 80; speed = 60; } { temp = 90; speed = 100; }
  ];
};
```

> The driver enforces a ~25 % on-speed floor; a requested duty below ~12 % becomes 0 (off).

## Roadmap (next)

- Charge-limit + keyboard-backlight options on the NixOS module (the GUI already drives them).
- Generalise beyond Uniwill-AMD Gen9 (model gating via `R_UW_MODEL_ID`).
- A VM-based NixOS test in CI (lint/build CI already runs on every push).

## Methodology (source-first, no black-box guessing)

- **The kernel module is GPL.** `tuxedo-drivers` defines the ioctl request numbers and
  structs. Read them; don't reverse the wire blind.
- **`strace -e ioctl` the existing daemons** (`tailord`, and `tccd` if obtainable) to see
  the exact `TUXEDO_IO_*` calls and argument values on *this* board.
- **Cross-reference the two implementations**: tuxedo-rs (Rust, MIT) and TCC (`tccd`, GPL).
  The divergence explains the Uniwill-AMD fan bug.
- Validate every step on real hardware via the prober before baking it into the daemon.

## Prior art / references

- `tuxedo-drivers`: the GPL kernel modules (ioctl source of truth).
- `tuxedo-rs` (tailord): Rust daemon, MIT; the base to fix or learn from.
- `tuxedo-control-center`: the official Electron app + `tccd`.
- `blitz/tuxedo-nixos`: an existing community flake; evaluate as a packaging reference.

## Supported hardware

A board is listed as **validated** only once fan control has been exercised on it.

| Model | Board | `tuxedo_io` | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| TUXEDO InfinityBook Pro AMD Gen9 | `GXxHRXx` (Uniwill) | 0.3.9 | ✅ validated: fan, perf profile, keyboard backlight, charging profile |

Other Uniwill TUXEDO laptops may work but are **unverified**. Adding a board is a
deliberate, source-first process. See [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-support-for-a-new-board).
Features that the EC doesn't expose (e.g. TDP control returns `ENODEV` on the reference
board) are detected at runtime and hidden rather than guessed.

## Versioning

Pre-1.0. While `0.y.z`, any `0.y` release may change the CLI, the daemon's socket
protocol, the NixOS module options, or ioctl behaviour. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
