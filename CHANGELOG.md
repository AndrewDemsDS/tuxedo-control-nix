# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and
this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
While pre-1.0 (`0.y.z`), the public API, the NixOS module options, and ioctl behaviour
may change in any `0.y` release. See "Versioning" in the README.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Model gating via `R_UW_MODEL_ID` (generalise safely beyond the Gen9 reference board). The
  `tuxedoio` library refuses EC writes on any board whose model id is not in a known-models
  registry (`TuxedoIo::open`), so an unvalidated board runs read-only; the prober uses
  `TuxedoIo::open_unchecked` to validate new boards. The daemon logs the gating decision and
  surfaces `model_id` + `read_only` in its `STATUS` reply. See `docs/model-gating.md`.
- Simulated `tuxedo_io` EC test harness (`tuxedoio::sim`) with a per-model fixture table, plus a
  model-matrix test suite run in CI (`cargo test --workspace`). For each board it verifies the
  write-gate (only validated models are writable), fan-duty scaling, the `0x40` fan-ownership
  fix, performance-profile enforcement, and capability probes. A companion per-model **sysfs**
  matrix in the daemon (driven by the same fixtures) simulates `/sys` to check charging-profile
  presence-gating + enum validation and keyboard-backlight discovery + per-model
  `max_brightness`; plus unit tests for fan-curve interpolation and the safety floor.

### Fixed
- Fan-duty oscillation ("hunting"): the control loop read the instantaneous temperature each
  tick and rewrote the fan duty on every 1 °C of sensor noise, so the fan audibly ramped up and
  down. It now EMA-smooths the temperature (curve follows the trend, not spikes) and applies a
  duty deadband (small changes hold the current duty), so the fan settles and stays steady. The
  safety floor still uses the raw temperature, so real heat gets an immediate response. Measured:
  on the reference board the fan went from a change every few seconds to one change in 70 s at idle.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added
- Module options `keyboard.backlight.brightness` and `charging.profile`, re-asserted by
  the daemon on every start (declarative keyboard backlight and battery charging profile).
- NixOS VM test (`checks.vm-test`): boots a VM with the module enabled and asserts the unit
  wiring, that tuxedo-rs/tailord is disabled, that the declarative options reach the daemon
  config, and that the daemon fails gracefully without hardware. Runs in GitHub CI.

### Changed
- GUI fan-curve editor now labels both axes: temperature in °C and fan duty in %, with
  per-tick units and "Temperature (°C)" / "Fan duty (%)" axis titles.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-27

### Added
- `tuxedoio` crate: wrappers over the `/dev/tuxedo_io` Uniwill ioctl interface (read
  temps/fan duty/mode, set fan duty, set performance profile, restore EC auto).
- `tuxedo-prober`: standalone tool to read temps/fan, drive fan duty, and toggle the
  `0x40` fan-ownership bit, used to validate the protocol on real hardware.
- `tuxedo-controld` daemon: temperature→duty fan curve with hysteresis, performance-
  profile control, a Unix control socket, and restores EC auto on `SIGTERM`.
- NixOS module `services.tuxedo-control` plus flake outputs (package, module, dev shell,
  checks, formatter).
- `tuxedo-tui`: live terminal dashboard.
- `tuxedo-gui`: libadwaita/GTK4 front-end with keyboard-backlight and charging-profile
  controls, dark-mode / follow-system colour scheme.
- Named performance profiles with their own fan curves (create/delete/default), built-in
  profiles modelled on TUXEDO Control Center, and import of TCC's exported profiles.
- Documentation: source-derived ioctl protocol map and root-cause analysis of the
  Uniwill-AMD fan bug.

### Fixed
- Loud-fan-at-idle bug on Uniwill-AMD boards: `uw_set_fan` silently ignores the
  requested duty unless bit `0x40` of EC RAM `0x0751` is clear. The daemon now clears
  `0x40` before every fan write.

### Known limitations
- Validated only on the reference machine (TUXEDO InfinityBook Pro AMD Gen9, Uniwill,
  `tuxedo_io` v0.3.9). Other boards are unverified. See "Supported hardware".
- The driver enforces a ~25% on-speed floor; a requested duty below ~12% becomes 0 (off).
